# Pore-c Workflow

## THIS IS A FORK OF THE ORIGINAL PORE-C WORKFLOW OF EPI2ME LABS https://github.com/epi2me-labs/wf-pore-c

Workflow for analysing Pore-c data for chromatin conformation capture.



## Introduction

Pore-C is an end-to-end workflow unique to Oxford Nanopore which combines chromatin conformation capture (3C) with direct, long nanopore sequencing reads. With nanopore reads, long-range, multi-way contact information can be obtained. 

This workflow can be used for the following:

* Pre-processing a reference genome or draft assembly to generate auxiliary files used in downstream analyses.
* Creating virtual digests of Pore-c reads.
* Filtering the raw reads to remove any that might break downstream tools.
* Align virtually digested reads against a reference genome.
* Processing results to filter spurious alignments, detect ligation junctions and assign fragments.
* Outputting aligned, sorted and annotated BAM files.
* Generating a contact map, which shows the intensity of the physical interaction between two genome regions.
* Create output files for downstream analysis in the following formats.
  - [Pairs format](https://github.com/4dn-dcic/pairix/blob/master/pairs_format_specification.md)
  - [Cooler format](https://mirnylab.github.io/cooler/)
  - [Hic format](https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer/wiki/)



## Compute requirements

Recommended requirements:

+ CPUs = 64
+ Memory = 128GB

Minimum requirements:

+ CPUs = 8
+ Memory = 32GB

Approximate run time: 12 hours for 100GB input BAM using the recommended resources, this will vary depending on number of monomers found per read.

ARM processor support: False




## Install and run

<!---Nextflow text remains the same across workflows, update example cmd and demo data sections.--->
These are instructions to install and run the workflow on command line. You can also access the workflow via the [EPI2ME application](https://labs.epi2me.io/downloads/).

The workflow uses [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) to manage compute and software resources, therefore nextflow will need to be installed before attempting to run the workflow.

The workflow can currently be run using either [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) or
[Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/index.html) to provide isolation of
the required software. Both methods are automated out-of-the-box provided
either docker or singularity is installed. This is controlled by the [`-profile`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html#config-profiles) parameter as exemplified below. Note that Singularity is now called Apptainer. If you choose running `-profile singularity`, please make sure that the command `singularity` can be run on your computer. 

It is not required to clone or download the git repository in order to run the workflow.
More information on running EPI2ME workflows can be found on our [website](https://labs.epi2me.io/wfindex).

The following command can be used to obtain the workflow. This will pull the repository in to the assets folder of nextflow and provide a list of all parameters available for the workflow as well as an example command:

```
nextflow run epi2me-labs/wf-pore-c --help
```
A demo dataset is provided for testing of the workflow. It can be downloaded using:
```
wget -O wf-pore-c-demo.tar.gz https://ont-exd-int-s3-euwst1-epi2me-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/wf-pore-c/wf-pore-c-demo.tar.gz && \
tar -xzvf wf-pore-c-demo.tar.gz

```
The workflow can be run with the demo data using:
```
nextflow run epi2me-labs/wf-pore-c \
--bam wf-pore-c-demo/porec_test.concatemers.bam --chunk_size 100 \
--ref wf-pore-c-demo/porec_test.fasta \
--cutter NlaIII \
--vcf wf-pore-c-demo/porec_test.phased_variants.vcf.gz \
--paired_end_minimum_distance 100 --paired_end_maximum_distance 200 --hi_c --mcool --paired_end
```

## Pipeline overview

### 1. Concatenate input files and generate per read stats.

This workflow accepts FASTQ or unaligned BAM as input. [Fastcat or Bamstats](https://github.com/epi2me-labs/fastcat) tool is used to concatenate multifile samples to be processed by the workflow. It will also output per read stats including average read lengths and qualities.

### 2. Index reference

The input reference genome is indexed with [Minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2).

### 3. Split input file

The reads are indexed in chunks for parallel processing using the `chunk_size` parameter which is defaulted to 10,000.

### 4. Digest Reads

Chimeric Pore-C reads are digested using the [Pore-c-py](https://github.com/epi2me-labs/pore-c-py) python package. The enzyme provided to the `cutter` parameter will be used by the Pore-c-py package to find the corresponding sequence using the [Biopython](https://biopython.org/) restriction enzymes library. Any reads containing more than `max_monomers` (default: 250) will be excluded at this stage as they are assumed to have been created in error.

### 5. Align Reads

The monomers are then aligned with the reference genome using Minimap2.

### 6. Annotate

The Pore-c-py package is then used again to filter spurious alignments, detect ligation junctions and assign chimeric fragments. The aligned segmnets will be used to generate a "walk" which enumerates the alignment coordinates of the monomers comprising the chimeric read and this is used to annotate the alignments.

### 7. Output BAMS

The Pore-c-py will output the tagged alignments in a name sorted and coordinate sorted BAM. If the `paired_end` parameter is selected a mock paired end bam will also be output, this is for use with downstream tools such as [Pairtools](https://github.com/open2c/pairtools). At this stage if the [Chromunity](https://github.com/mskilab-org/chromunity) parameter is set to true the annotate script will also output the parquet files required for us with the downstream Chromunity tool.

### 8. Haplotag Alignments

If a phased VCF is provided using the `vcf` parameter the output BAM will be haplotagged using [Whatshap](https://github.com/whatshap/whatshap).

### 9. Merge BAMS

The outputs BAM's from each of the split chunks will be merged and sorted per sample using [Samtools](https://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-merge.html).

### 10. Coverage is calculated

If the `coverage` parameter is set to true [Mosdepth](https://github.com/brentp/mosdepth) is used to find coverage across the input reference genome.

### 11. Additional output formats for downstream analysis

The workflow will output several formats that can be used with downstream tools. 

+ [Pairtools](https://github.com/open2c/pairtools) is used to create pairs format file and html report which contains a contact map and other statistics. Use the `pairs` parameter for the workflow to generate this output.

+ [Cooler](https://github.com/open2c/cooler) is used to output cooler format for use with cooler, a multi-resolution contact map. Use the `mcool` parameter to generate this output.

+ [Juicer](https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer) tools is used to create `.hic` format file which can be used for visualising the file which can be loaded into the [Juice box tool](https://www.aidenlab.org/juicebox/) for an alternative contact map visualisation. Use the `hi_c` parameter to generate this output. 



## Troubleshooting

<!---Any additional tips.--->
+ If the workflow fails please run it with the demo data set to ensure the workflow itself is working. This will help us determine if the issue is related to the environment, input parameters or a bug.
+ See how to interpret some common nextflow exit codes [here](https://labs.epi2me.io/trouble-shooting/).
+ If the workflow breaks with a memory error, try running the workflow again with a reduced chunk size parameter.



## FAQ's

<!---Frequently asked questions, pose any known limitations as FAQ's.--->
* Does the workflow have support for a scaffolding tool? * - Currently we do not support any scaffolding tool but you may like to try [Yahs](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/39/1/btac808/6917071).

If your question is not answered here, please report any issues or suggestions on the [github issues](https://github.com/epi2me-labs/wf-pore-c/issues) page or start a discussion on the [community](https://community.nanoporetech.com/).
